          I spearheaded the development of an engaging language learning
          platform, focusing on three interactive gamesâ€”Reading Rocketship,
          Writing Wormhole, and Lunar Listening. These games were designed to
          foster language acquisition through immersive and entertaining
          experiences.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In the Reading Rocketship game, students embark on a language journey
          by selecting the correct translation from a set of words presented on
          the screen. Success in choosing the accurate translation propels a
          rocketship upward until it launches into space.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Writing Wormhole immerses students in sentence construction. They
          are presented with a sentence to form using a selection of foreign
          words. Students can partially guess, with highlighted portions, and
          are tasked with completing the sentence in the correct order. However,
          partial guesses impact the overall score, encouraging students to
          strive for accuracy.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Lunar Listening engages students in auditory language
          comprehension. By clicking on audio files, users listen to clips of
          foreign words and match them to the correct translations. Incorrect
          guesses lead to score deductions, motivating students to refine their
          listening skills.

          Pioneered the development of a robust booking flow generation tool for

        <li>
          Implemented a notification system that communicates booking details to

        <li>
          Developed the ability for users to adjust their bookings by adding or
